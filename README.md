# Stock-Management-System

The Java-based Stock Trading Application is a
simulated platform designed for users to engage in virtual stock
trading. The application offers functionalities to buy and sell
stocks, manage user balance, and track stock price fluctuations.
Developed using Java's Swing library, the graphical interface
provides a seamless user experience. The system initializes with
preset stock options and prices, allowing users to simulate buying
and selling shares based on current prices and user balance
The core features include a dropdown menu to select stocks, an
input field to specify the quantity of stocks, buttons for buying and
selling, and options to add or withdraw funds from the user's
balance. Real-time stock prices are displayed and updated as users
transact. The application simulates price changes, affecting the
stock prices after each transaction. Additionally, it incorporates
error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient balances during
transactions.
