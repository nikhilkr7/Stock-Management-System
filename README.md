# Stock-Management-System

The Java-based Stock Trading Application is a
simulated platform designed for users to engage in virtual stock
trading. The application offers functionalities to buy and sell
stocks, manage user balance, and track stock price fluctuations.
Developed using Java's Swing library, the graphical interface
provides a seamless user experience. The system initializes with
preset stock options and prices, allowing users to simulate buying
and selling shares based on current prices and user balance
The core features include a dropdown menu to select stocks, an
input field to specify the quantity of stocks, buttons for buying and
selling, and options to add or withdraw funds from the user's
balance. Real-time stock prices are displayed and updated as users
transact. The application simulates price changes, affecting the
stock prices after each transaction. Additionally, it incorporates
error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient balances during
transactions.

# OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of the Stock Management System is to develop a
comprehensive Java-based application that simulates stock trading functionalities
within a graphical user interface. This project aims to facilitate user interaction with
stock transactions, enabling buying, selling, fund management, and real-time price
tracking for various stocks. Through this system, the goal is to provide a practical
platform for users to gain hands-on experience in understanding stock market
dynamics, investment strategies, and financial decision-making within a controlled,
virtual environment. Additionally, the project aims to demonstrate proficiency in
Java's Swing library, event-driven programming, data manipulation, and error
handling.
